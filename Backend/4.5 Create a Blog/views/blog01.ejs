"I am HERE!Wed Mar 20 2024 20:41:48 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)What the hell is a gigawatt? I said the keys are in here. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? You have this thing hooked up to the car?\r\n\r\nBecause, you might regret it later in life. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Uh, Doc. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.\r\n\r\nSo tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port? Actually, people call me Marty. Oh yes sir. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.\r\n\r\n"
